# Digit Recognizer
Detection of Numbers from a given feature set drawn out of Images.

MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. In this project, I have tried to predict the digits using KNN Classification method without any library but by coding from the scratch.

The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Here is the link to the dataset. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The repository contains programs to convert the data files from byte format to csv format (convert.py) and the classification program (classify.py).
